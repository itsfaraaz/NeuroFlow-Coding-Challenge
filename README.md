Hello!

This is my project-based coding challenge for NeuroFlow.

I created this project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The only library I used was Bootstrap to build out an elegant user interface. Other than that, all the logic is built using pure Javascript.

In this project, I use many new Javascript features introduced in JS ES6 such as Arrow functions. Please run this application only on modern browsers such as Google Chrome.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my project!
