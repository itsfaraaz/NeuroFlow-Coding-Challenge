Hello!

This is my project-based coding challenge for NeuroFlow.

I created this project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The only library I used was Bootstrap to build out an elegant user interface. Other than that, all the logic is built using pure Javascript.

**Please note:** the times in the "Date Released" column only shows 12:00am because the given JSON file does not specify a time for the date released.

In this project, I use many new Javascript features introduced in JS ES6 such as Arrow functions. Please run this website only on modern browsers such as Google Chrome.

You can download the project and run it on your local machine. Alternatively, you can visit https://itsfaraaz.github.io/NeuroFlow-Coding-Challenge/ where I've hosted a live version.

**IMPORTANT**: If you download the project and run it locally on your machine, you **must** run it on a HTTPS connection as most browsers will not allow you to load a JSON file locally via Javascript for security reasons. Consider using the live server built into Brackets or VSCode.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my project!
